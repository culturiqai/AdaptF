## **1\. The Breakthrough**

**AdaptF** is a novel neural network architecture that overcomes the fundamental scaling limitations of standard transformers, enabling **true global context understanding** for arbitrarily long sequences with near-linear O(n log n) complexity.

Unlike standard attention mechanisms, which are constrained by O(nÂ²) complexity and memory usage, AdaptF processes entire book-length documents in a single, unified pass. This allows for a deep, holistic understanding of text that is impossible for models reliant on windowing or other approximation techniques.

The core innovation is a **direct frequency-domain analogue of the attention mechanism**. By reformulating the interaction between queries (Q) and keys (K) as a dynamic, content-specific filter in the Fourier domain, AdaptF preserves the proven expressive power of attention while eliminating its quadratic bottleneck.

**This technology was developed by a solo founder in one month with zero external funding.**

## **2\. Key Features & Capabilities**

* **O(n log n) Complexity:** Fundamentally more efficient than standard attention, enabling practical processing of massive sequences.  
* **True Global Context:** The entire input sequence is processed holistically. Every token informs every other token, ensuring no loss of long-range dependencies.  
* **Extreme Efficiency:** Demonstrably capable of high-speed inference on consumer-grade hardware (e.g., Apple M-series chips), breaking the dependency on expensive, power-hungry data center GPUs for long-context tasks.  
* **Attention Analogue:** Retains the powerful, dynamic Q-K interaction principle that made transformers the standard in NLP, ensuring high-quality, nuanced language understanding.

## **3\. Performance Highlights**

AdaptF has been successfully tested on documents and at sequence lengths that far exceed the limits of conventional AI models.

**Landmark Demonstration:**

* **Input:** The full, unabridged text of Herman Melville's "Moby Dick" (\~293,000 tokens).  
* **Task:** Perform a full-text extractive Question & Answering query.  
* **Hardware:** Apple M4 Pro (consumer laptop chip, using only 3-4 cores).  
* **Result:** **Successful retrieval from the end of the document in seconds.**

This result validates the architecture's ability to handle massive contexts with unprecedented efficiency on accessible hardware.

**Comparative CPU Benchmarks at Scale:** While simpler architectures may show higher raw throughput on short sequences, AdaptF demonstrates exceptional performance and stability at massive sequence lengths. It remains robust where other sophisticated models can fail on CPU hardware.

| Sequence Length | AdaptF (tokens/sec) |
| :---- | :---- |
| 4,096 | \~33,000 |
| 16,384 | \~27,000 |
| 32,768 | \~26,000 |
| **65,536** | **\~18,000** |

*(Results from an unoptimized, one-month-old reference implementation, showing graceful performance scaling.)*

## **4\. Architectural Advantage**

AdaptF occupies a unique and powerful position in the landscape of modern AI architectures.

| Model Family | Core Mechanism | Adaptivity | Connection to Attention Logic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| FNet, FFTNet, AFNO | Learned or static frequency-domain mixing. | No, or via a single globally learned filter. | Indirect or None. |
| Hyena, Mamba/S4 | Long convolutions or structured state-space models. | Yes, but via different architectural paradigms. | Architecturally different. |
| **AdaptF (Ours)** | **Dynamic convolutional filter from Q and K.** | **Yes, highly content-specific per input.** | **Direct Analogue.** |

**Our key differentiator is that we don't replace attention; we have found a more efficient way to compute it.**

## **5\. Potential Applications**

The efficiency and power of AdaptF unlock high-value commercial applications that are currently infeasible.

* **Legal Tech:** Instantaneous e-discovery and contract analysis across entire case files containing thousands of pages.  
* **Financial Analysis:** Deep analysis of decades of annual reports, SEC filings, and transcripts in a single query.  
* **Scientific R\&D:** A "Discovery Engine" that can read, understand, and connect insights across the entire body of published literature in a specific field.  
* **On-Device AI:** Powering privacy-first, offline-capable AI features on consumer desktops and future mobile devices.

## **6\. Project Status & Roadmap**

* **Current Status:** A stable, high-performance proof-of-concept demonstrating the core architectural breakthrough.  
* **Next Steps:**  
  1. **Optimization:** Implement standard techniques (e.g., quantization, custom GPU kernels) to further boost performance.  
  2. **Productization:** Build a first-in-class SaaS application targeting a high-value vertical (e.g., Legal Tech).  
  3. **LLM Development:** Evolve the architecture into a full, causal, generative LLM to create a complete platform for "Discovery as a Service."

We are seeking partners and investment to accelerate this roadmap and bring this transformative technology to market.
