1. The Breakthrough
AdaptF is a novel neural network architecture that overcomes the fundamental scaling limitations of standard transformers, enabling true global context understanding for arbitrarily long sequences with near-linear O(n log n) complexity.

Unlike standard attention mechanisms, which are constrained by O(nÂ²) complexity and memory usage, AdaptF processes entire book-length documents in a single, unified pass. This allows for a deep, holistic understanding of text that is impossible for models reliant on windowing or other approximation techniques.

The core innovation is a direct frequency-domain analogue of the attention mechanism. By reformulating the interaction between queries (Q) and keys (K) as a dynamic, content-specific filter in the Fourier domain, AdaptF preserves the proven expressive power of attention while eliminating its quadratic bottleneck.

This technology was developed by a solo founder in one month with zero external funding.

2. Key Features & Capabilities
O(n log n) Complexity: Fundamentally more efficient than standard attention, enabling practical processing of massive sequences.

True Global Context: The entire input sequence is processed holistically. Every token informs every other token, ensuring no loss of long-range dependencies.

Extreme Efficiency: Demonstrably capable of high-speed inference on consumer-grade hardware (e.g., Apple M-series chips), breaking the dependency on expensive, power-hungry data center GPUs for long-context tasks.

Attention Analogue: Retains the powerful, dynamic Q-K interaction principle that made transformers the standard in NLP, ensuring high-quality, nuanced language understanding.

3. Performance Highlights
AdaptF has been successfully tested on documents far exceeding the limits of conventional AI models.

Landmark Demonstration:

Input: The full, unabridged text of Herman Melville's "Moby Dick" (~293,000 tokens).

Task: Perform a full-text extractive Q&A query.

Hardware: Apple M4 Pro (consumer laptop chip, using only 3-4 cores).

Result: Successful retrieval from the end of the document in seconds.

This result validates the architecture's ability to handle massive contexts with unprecedented efficiency on accessible hardware.

Comparative CPU Benchmarks:
While some simpler, non-adaptive architectures (like FNet, AFNO) show higher raw throughput on short sequences, AdaptF delivers best-in-class performance among architectures that provide high-quality, dynamic, content-aware processing. It remains robust and performant at sequence lengths where other sophisticated models (like Mamba) fail on CPU.

Our key differentiator is that we don't replace attention; we have found a more efficient way to compute it.

5. Potential Applications
The efficiency and power of AdaptF unlock high-value commercial applications that are currently infeasible.

Legal Tech: Instantaneous e-discovery and contract analysis across entire case files containing thousands of pages.

Financial Analysis: Deep analysis of decades of annual reports, SEC filings, and transcripts in a single query.

Scientific R&D: A "Discovery Engine" that can read, understand, and connect insights across the entire body of published literature in a specific field.

On-Device AI: Powering privacy-first, offline-capable AI features on consumer desktops and future mobile devices.

6. Project Status & Roadmap
Current Status: A stable, high-performance proof-of-concept demonstrating the core architectural breakthrough.

Next Steps:

Optimization: Implement standard techniques (e.g., quantization, custom GPU kernels) to further boost performance.

Productization: Build a first-in-class SaaS application targeting a high-value vertical (e.g., Legal Tech).

LLM Development: Evolve the architecture into a full, causal, generative LLM to create a complete platform for "Discovery as a Service."

We are seeking partners and investment to accelerate this roadmap and bring this transformative technology to market.
