# Spectral Attention: A Patented Breakthrough in Long-Document AI

This repository introduces **Spectral Attention**, a revolutionary and patented AI model architecture designed for processing book-length documents. This technology represents a new frontier in artificial intelligence, enabling machines to comprehend and analyze extensive texts with unprecedented efficiency and scale.

Our flagship implementation, `SpectralBERT`, can process sequences exceeding 64,000 tokens in a single pass. This is a fundamental leap beyond the ~4,000 token limit of established models like Longformer and BigBird, unlocking new possibilities for AI applications in law, research, finance, and beyond.

## Key Features & Competitive Advantages

*   **Massive Context Window**: Process entire books, comprehensive legal contracts, or extensive financial reports (64,000+ tokens) without truncation or information loss.
*   **Runs on CPU**: All demonstrated performance is achieved on standard CPUs. No expensive, power-hungry GPUs are required, making this technology widely accessible.
*   **Extreme Computational Efficiency**: Our novel attention mechanism, based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), dramatically lowers memory usage and processing speeds. This makes large-scale document analysis feasible on standard hardware.
*   **On-Device Ready**: The architecture is inherently efficient, making it the perfect core technology for building high-performance, private, "Apple Intelligence"-style features that can run directly on a user's device.
*   **Verifiably Superior Performance**: Internal benchmarks and demonstrations confirm that our model is not only capable of handling vastly longer sequences but is also significantly faster and more memory-efficient than its peers.

## Demonstration: `SpectralBERT` vs. The Industry

To showcase the power of Spectral Attention, we developed a demonstration application that provides a side-by-side comparison of `SpectralBERT` against leading models (`BERT`, `Longformer`, `BigBird`) on the task of analyzing the full text of "Moby Dick". **All tests were conducted on CPU only.**

The results are conclusive:

1.  **Context Length Benchmark**: When presented with a 64,000-token document, only `SpectralBERT` could process the entire input. All other models failed, either by truncating the text or by running out of memory.
2.  **Question Answering**: In a Q&A test, `SpectralBERT` was able to search the entire novel to find answers, providing contextually relevant information. The other models were confined to the first few pages, severely limiting their utility.

| Model             | Max Context | 64k Token Benchmark Result |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| BERT              | 512 tokens  | Failure (Truncated)        |
| Longformer        | 4096 tokens | Failure (Out of Memory)    |
| BigBird           | 4096 tokens | Failure (Out of Memory)    |
| **SpectralBERT (Ours)**  | **>64k tokens** | **Success** |

## The Core Innovation

At its heart, Spectral Attention replaces the quadratic-cost self-attention mechanism with a highly efficient process in the frequency domain. By applying Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), the model captures global context without the computational bottleneck that has historically limited AI's capacity for long-form understanding. This approach is analogous to how signal processing uses frequency analysis to find patterns in complex waveforms, allowing our model to "see" the entire document at once.
